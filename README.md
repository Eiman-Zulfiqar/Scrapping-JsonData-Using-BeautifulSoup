# Scrapping-JsonData-Using-BeautifulSoup
		# HTML to JSON Data Extraction and Web Display with BeautifulSou
		Extract JSON data from HTML pages using BeautifulSoup and display it dynamically on a user-friendly webpage. Simplify the process of parsing and transforming HTML sources into structured JSON data for easy visualization and exploration. A powerful tool for efficient data extraction and web display.
		

		The project consists of two main components: data extraction and web display. The data extraction process involves parsing HTML pages using BeautifulSoup and locating the desired JSON data within the HTML structure. Once the JSON data is extracted, it undergoes transformation to ensure it is in a structured format suitable for display.
